“Why don’t you like me?” is a social experiment that seeks to determine the nature of behaviour when presented the opportunity to provide opinion without context. By presenting a pair of identical boxes with a familiar and inviting interaction mechanism in the form of a giant like button and a like count, the viewer intuitively knows how to interact with the piece and is faced with a series of choices: Do I press the button? If so, which one? What about the other one?

“Why don’t you like me?” is an installation of two identical boxes placed about 5 feet away from each other. Presented to the viewer is a screen and a giant glowing button resembling the original Facebook like button. Pressing the button increases the count on the screen and triggers a soft haptic actuator that recreates the modern smartphone experience. Having interactive touch objects allows the viewer to have a tactile connection with the work and resonate with it in their own way, almost as if they were liking something on their own phone screen.

“Why don’t you like me?” furthermore construes the idea of mindless scrolling and liking on social media by younger generations. By creating physical boxes to demonstrate this everyday action, the piece not only recreates the physical click of the like button, but also makes  the viewer aware of their actions as they stop to think about what is being liked, why it is being liked, and what those likes mean. The installation encourages viewers to reflect on their own actions on social media and to question their motivations when choosing to like certain posts.
